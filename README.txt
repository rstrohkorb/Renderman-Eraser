To run, execute python file eraser.py. Both the age of the eraser and the random seed used to generate the texture can be adjusted by changing the parameters on lines 138 and 139.

Make sure that the two shader files (diffuseShader.osl and displacementShader.osl) are in the same folder as eraser.py. The textures folder also needs to be in this folder.
